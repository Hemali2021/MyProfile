        <P>Kalutara Bodhiya is an old Bodhi tree which is identified as one of the 32 saplings of Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi
            which was planted during the reign of king Devanampiyatissa in the 2nd century BC at Anuradhapura,Sri Lanka.
            According to ancient chronicle Sinhala Bodhiwamsa, 32 saplings of sacred figs, which were sprouted from
            Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, were planted in various parts of the country as instructed by Arahant Mahinda Thera.
            Further the chronicle states that this Bodhi tree existed intact till the 15th century AD.</P>

        <p>However it is said that the Buddhist public started to consider this place as a sacred place after a Pandyan
            prince named Wickrema Pandya planted a Bodhi tree at the Pahala Maluwa of the Kaluthara Bodhi premises
            in 1042 AD.Prince Wickrema Pandya served as a viceroy in Kalutara area during that period. After the
            Portuguese took over the control of Maritime Provinces of Sri Lanka in 16th century, the site of the
            Kalutara Bodhiya was converted into a fort probably due to strategic importance of its location.</p>

        <p>After the Portuguese, the Dutch and the English, who succeeded them as colonial rulers of Sri Lanka, also
            used Kalutara Bodhi premises for administrative and military purposes. During the 19th century when the
            British government started to construct railroads in Sri Lanka, it was decided to remove this Bodhi tree
            as it was obstructing the initial plans to build the Kalutara Railway bridge. But it was later decided to
            construct the bridge without harming the Bodhi tree, due to the protests made by the Buddhist public, who
            were led by Sandanayake Upasaka, a Buddhist layman in Kalutara area.</p>

        <p>The modern development of Kalutara Bodhiya as a religious place initiated when the Kalutara Buddhist Society
            was formed in 1931. The main objectives of this society were the welfare of the Buddhists and the development
            of Buddhism in Kalutara area. After Ceylon gained independence from Britain in 1948, the newly appointed
            government led by Prime Minister Rt. Hon. D. S. Senanayake, on the request made by Sir. Cyrill de Soysa,
            took measures to remove other establishments from the area to keep the Kalutara Bodhiya site only for
            religious purposes.</p>

        <p>The Kalutara Bodhi Trust (KBT) was established by Sir Cyril de Zoysa, a prominent lawyer, senator and notary
            public, with the help of six other lawyers in November 7, 1951.[7] The prime objective of the Kalutara Bodhi
            Trust is the “Protection and Nurturing of Historic Kalutara Bodhiya”.[8] Sir Ernest de Silva was the first
            chairman of the KBT. Although Kalutara Bodhi Trust was initially confined to Kalutara region in its scope of
            work, today it has expanded its operation by going beyond from its initial objective for the sake of Buddha
            Sasana in Sri Lanka.</p>

        <p>Presently Kalutara Bodhi Trust serves as a non-profit organization which empowers the education and health
            sectors as well as the civil society in Sri Lanka. In addition to the protection and development of Kalutara
            Bodhiya, its other main objective is to alleviate poverty and giving humanitarian assistance to the needy
            sectors of the Sri Lankan population to achieve sustainable development and welfare of the society.
            In addition to that KBT is also involved in conducting Blood Donation Programmes and programmes to save
            cattle from death on every other poya days.</p>
